## [Unreleased]

## [2.3.0] - 2025-10-14

### Added
- **Context API Support**: New Context API for improved state management and component integration
  - `ModalSheetProvider`: Context provider for managing multiple modal sheets
  - `ModalSheetContext`: Context for accessing modal sheet state and controls
  - `useModalSheet`: Custom hook for accessing modal sheet context in child components
  - Enables imperative control of modal sheets from anywhere in the component tree
  - Simplifies coordination between multiple modal sheets

### Changed
- Enhanced modular architecture with centralized state management
- Improved TypeScript types for context and provider components

### Technical Improvements
- Better separation of concerns with Context API integration
- Cleaner component communication patterns
- Enhanced developer experience with hook-based API

## [2.2.1] - 2025-10-13

### Fixed
- **Backdrop Opacity Issue with `avoidKeyboard`**: Fixed race condition that caused backdrop to appear washed out when using `avoidKeyboard={true}`
  - The keyboard animation was interrupting the modal opening animation, causing the backdrop opacity to stop mid-animation
  - Added synchronization check to ensure opening animation completes before keyboard adjustment runs
  - Backdrop now consistently reaches its target opacity regardless of keyboard timing
  - Affected users with forms and text inputs that open the keyboard immediately after modal appears

### Technical Details
- Fixed race condition in `useModalAnimations` hook where keyboard `useEffect` would start a new animation on `translateY` while the parallel opening animation (including backdrop opacity) was still running
- Added `isImperativelyAnimating` check with interval-based waiting mechanism to prevent animation conflicts
- Ensures backdrop opacity animation always completes to its full value before keyboard adjustments are applied

## [2.2.0] - 2025-10-12

### Changed
- **Major Refactoring**: Reorganized codebase into modular architecture for better maintainability
  - Split component into separate modules (hooks, components, types, utils, constants)
  - Extracted animation logic into `useModalAnimations` hook
  - Extracted keyboard handling into `useKeyboardHandler` hook
  - Extracted touch/gesture handling into `useTouchHandler` hook
  - Extracted scroll handling into `useScrollHandler` hook
  - Created reusable UI components (`ModalSheetHandle`, `ModalSheetBackdrop`, `ModalSheetContent`)
  - Centralized constants and type definitions
  - Improved code organization and testability

### Technical Improvements
- Better separation of concerns with dedicated hooks for each feature
- Enhanced code reusability and maintainability
- Improved TypeScript type safety with dedicated type definitions
- Cleaner component structure with smaller, focused modules

### Notes
- This is a **non-breaking change** - the public API remains exactly the same
- All existing functionality preserved with improved internal architecture
- No migration required for existing users

## [2.1.2] - 2025-10-10

### Fixed
- Restored original single-file architecture to resolve module export issues
- Fixed "Element type is invalid" error that occurred with modular structure
- Cleaned build artifacts to ensure correct package distribution

## [2.1.1] - 2025-10-10

### Changed
- Attempted modular refactoring (reverted in 2.1.2 due to export issues)

## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-10

### Added
- **`enableDragAndDrop` Prop**: New optional prop for automatic GestureHandlerRootView wrapping
  - Set to `true` when using gesture-based components like DraggableFlatList
  - Eliminates need for manual GestureHandlerRootView wrapper in modal content
  - Default is `false` for better performance when gesture handling is not needed
  - Simplifies integration with react-native-draggable-flatlist and similar libraries

### Improved
- **Cleaner API**: Gesture-enabled components now work with a simple prop toggle
- **Better Performance**: GestureHandlerRootView only added when explicitly needed
- **Developer Experience**: Removed boilerplate code from examples

### Dependencies
- Added `react-native-gesture-handler` as a peer dependency (when using `enableDragAndDrop`)

## [2.0.1] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed
- Documentation updates and minor bug fixes

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-08

### Added - Major Feature: Scroll-to-Expand & Interactive Snap Points

#### Scroll-to-Expand Features
- **Natural Scrolling**: Expand/collapse sheet by scrolling within content
- **Velocity Detection**: Fast swipes jump multiple snap points or to extremes
- **Smart Boundaries**: Scroll up at top to collapse, scroll down to expand
- **New Props**:
  - `enableScrollToExpand`: Enable/disable scroll expansion (default: true)
  - `scrollExpandThreshold`: Pixels to scroll before triggering snap (default: 50)
- **New Ref Methods**:
  - `handleScroll`: Process scroll events for expansion
  - `handleScrollBeginDrag`: Track scroll gesture start
  - `handleScrollEndDrag`: Detect pull-down gestures at top

#### Interactive Snap Points
- **Flexible Definition**: Support for percentage strings (e.g., "50%") and SharedValue
- **Smooth Transitions**: Bezier curve easing for natural movement
- **Keyboard Awareness**: Snap points adjust when keyboard appears
- **Performance**: All animations use native driver at 60fps

### Breaking Changes
- `snapPoints` prop now accepts `(string | number)[]` instead of just `number[]`

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-08

### Added - Major Feature: Snap Points Implementation

#### Snap Point Features
- **Multi-Point Snapping**: Supports multiple snap heights (e.g., 30%, 60%, 90%)
- **Intelligent Detection**: Automatically snaps to closest snap point based on final drag position
- **Cross-Point Dragging**: Can skip multiple snap points in one continuous swipe
- **Direct Close**: Can close from any snap point without returning to smallest first
- **New Props**:
  - `snapPoints`: Array of snap positions (percentage or pixels)
  - `initialSnapIndex`: Starting snap point index (default: 0)
  - `enableScrollToExpand`: Enable scroll-to-expand behavior
  - `onSnapPointChange`: Callback when snap point changes
- **New Ref Method**: `snapToPoint(index)` - Programmatically snap to specific point

#### Architecture Improvements
- **Transform-Based Animation**: Switched from height changes to `translateY` transforms
  - All animations use `useNativeDriver: true` for 60fps performance
  - No more flickering or visual glitches during transitions
- **Full Height Rendering**: Modal sheet renders at maximum snap point height
  - Content is pre-rendered once and never recalculated
  - Eliminates layout recalculations during snap transitions
- **Viewport Drawer Approach**: Sheet acts like a drawer sliding behind a viewport

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Faster Animations**: Reduced from 200ms → **150ms** for quicker response
- **Predictable Timing**: Uses `Animated.timing` with `Easing.out(Easing.cubic)`
- **Animation Blocking**: Added `isAnimating` state to prevent gesture conflicts
- ✅ **No Layout Recalculations**: Content never re-renders during snaps
- ✅ **Native Driver**: All animations run on UI thread at 60fps
- ✅ **Memory Efficient**: Content rendered once, not recreated

### Fixed
- **Draggable List Example**: Fixed height constraint issue preventing items from rendering
  - Changed from `flex: 1` to explicit height calculation
  - Removed unnecessary `containerStyle` from DraggableFlatList

### Changed
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused viewport wrapper and simplified structure
- **Optimized Keyboard Handling**: Simplified keyboard event listeners

### Breaking Changes
None - All existing props and APIs remain backward compatible

## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-07

### Added
- **Draggable List Example**: New interactive drag & drop list example in modal sheet
  - 8 colorful draggable items with smooth animations
  - Long-press gesture to initiate drag
  - Spring-based drop animations for smooth transitions
  - Visual feedback during active drag (opacity and scale changes)
- **GestureHandlerRootView**: Added to Modal component for proper gesture support
  - Fixes gesture handler compatibility issues within React Native Modal
  - Enables draggable-flatlist to work correctly inside modals
- **Enhanced Gesture Isolation**: Swipe-to-close gesture now restricted to handle area only
  - Modal sheet handle area with dedicated pan responder
  - Content area remains fully interactive without gesture conflicts
  - Draggable list gestures work independently from modal dismiss gesture

### Changed
- **App Root Layout**: Wrapped with `GestureHandlerRootView` for global gesture support
- **Modal Sheet Architecture**: Refactored pan responder to only apply to handle area
  - Moved from full-sheet gesture detection to handle-only detection
  - Prevents gesture conflicts with interactive content inside modal

### Dependencies
- Added `react-native-draggable-flatlist` (^4.0.3)
  - Provides drag-and-drop functionality for FlatList
  - Includes ScaleDecorator for smooth scale animations
  - Powered by React Native Reanimated and Gesture Handler

### Technical Details
- Animation configuration: `damping: 20`, `stiffness: 100` for natural spring feel
- Item dimensions: 60px height for optimal touch target and gesture response
- Long-press delay: 70ms for quick drag initiation
- Gesture Handler integration fully compatible with Expo workflow
